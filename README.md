# AI-Powered Trading Platform

Welcome to the **AI-Powered Trading Platform** repository! This platform combines cutting-edge AI capabilities, blockchain technology, and seamless integration to deliver a state-of-the-art trading experience. It is designed to empower both individual traders and trade administrators to maximize profits, manage accounts efficiently, and execute trades with real-time intelligence.

‚ö†Ô∏è NOTICE

Due to build errors of a dependency this project was restarted from scratch a few times. The orignal code is available at the url below üëá. The new frontend code is a simplified version which has some features removed for the sake debugging and production build. Unfortunately the frontend developer has to go fullstack the project which cause some of the key features being reducted. Feel free to check the original code at the url below for contracts and Koii task.

## Functioinal Features

&nbsp;

Currently the features working are:

1. AI Chat - For chatting with an LLM to get trading advice. The LLM is capable of providing insight into trading and some data about the market. It is also capable of provising take profit, stop loss and lot size for trades.

2. Peer-to-Peer chat system - This chat system was designed so as to allow users to communicate with each other. It is a simple chat system that allows users to send messages and create group chats for some amusement. This chat system will provide user data based on their individual discussions and group chat creating a personality profile for the user which will be used by an AI agent to design a trading strategy based on the user's intrests, assit in portfolio management and diversification as well as recommendations.

3. Admin Panel - This is for admin traders. There are two types of users on the platform, one is a standard user and the other is a trade admin. Standard users are regular traders who can only view their own account information and trade history. Trade admins are users who have been granted the ability to manage user accounts, a standard user goes into agreement with a trade admin to trade on their behalf and by signing a zk proof forming a sort of trust link so that the trade admin can execute trades on behalf of the standard user. These trades are done using virtual balances so as not to let trade admins steal user funds or misuse them. The implementation of this is currently minimal due to the build issues. In the signage contrat both traders agree on the percentage of profits made in trades.

4. Prop firm - Prop Firms are one of the ways beginners attain capital to start trading. Here we have a pool for which users can contribute to and then the pool is used to fund accounts of traders who request for it. The pool has side benefits depending on agreements clause added, for some a user will get an interest percentage on how much they contribute and will be notified how much was used to funds another user.

5. Trade execution - This is the part of the application that makes money for users. This is supposed to b for users to create their trades to execute. The contract has been defined for this but due to build issues no integration for it was made .

6. Trading History - This just displays users trading history and how their account is fairing.

## Technologies Used

### **Core Technologies**

- **iExec**: Provides decentralized computing power for AI model execution, data sharing, and secure data access through Data Protectors and Web3Mail. With iExec the platform provides a means to onboard users from web2 using emails or other socials providing them with an on-chain address.

  Through iExec the platform will setup a trading strategy analysis signal sharing where users can share their trading strategy with other users and get rewarded by users subscribing to their strategies. This will be done through a decentralized marketplace where users can buy and sell trading strategies.

  iExec will faciliate a base layer security by protecting the data and the AI models from being copied or stolen. For data such as historical trades, chats summary, trading strategies, trading hostory, admin accounts management and other platform data, iExec will be used to protect these data and leveraging ZK most of these data can be shared without revealing the data itself or its source.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

- **Citrea**: Manages complex workflows, ensuring AI and user actions are synchronized effectively. The solidty smart contract was deployed on Citrea and the smart contract handles:
  Sub-Account Management: Creation, storage, and management of sub-accounts with associated admins, along with profit-sharing between users and admins.

  1. Trade Execution and Completion: Tracks individual trades, ensures admins manage specific accounts and trades, and distributes profits from completed trades.

  2. Profit Distribution: Shares profits according to a predefined percentage between sub-account owners and admins, and transfers funds securely.

  3. User Balances: Allows deposits and withdrawals for sub-account owners.

  4. Transparency and Access Control: Enforces authorization for admins and sub-account owners, and provides transparency through public mappings and functions.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

- **Koii**: Facilitates decentralized content validation and distribution for learning modules and rewards with platform tokens. On Koii, users can create, share, and monetize on the platform.

  Here are some of the ways users can earn and how Koii helps us:

  1. With Koii we have deployed AI tasks that run out predictive models. The predictive models are used to predict the performance of a trading strategy, price of market intruments from stocks, crypto, forex, indexes and so on. Looking at the number of instruments out there it is significant that a lot of tasks will be available for users and earn a lot. Although there is a required metric that will be checked so we ensure we are getting good results.

  2. Users will also be able to create tasks for their own use cases. A user can create a task to test a trading strategy and other users can participate in the task and earn tokens. This will be a great way for users to earn tokens especially for beginner traders who need capital to start trading.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

- **StarkNet**: Offers scalable and secure Layer 2 solutions for faster blockchain interactions, supporting smart contracts for specific services like profit sharing. For starkent the contract centralizes around these main functions:

  1. Confidential Agreement Handling: Use StarkNet's zk-proof capabilities for private agreement handling, complementing Solidity's references to confidential agreements.

  2. High-Frequency Trading Logic: Optimize high-frequency trade computations with Cairo and StarkNet for better performance.

  3. Workflow Orchestration: Implement complex workflows for trade allocation, profit distribution, and balance updates using StarkNet's zk capabilities.

  4. Enhanced Privacy for Sub-Accounts: Utilize zk-proofs to manage private data for sub-accounts without public exposure.

  5. Cross-Chain Communication: Implement data synchronization between Citrea and StarkNet if both platforms are used.

  &nbsp;
  &nbsp;

  StarkNet Contract System Components:

  1. Main Contract (main.cairo): Manages contract state, core interfaces, event emissions, module coordination, and access control.

  2. Identity & Trust Module (identity_manager.cairo): Handles trust agreement implementation, zk-proof identity verification, privacy-preserving credentials, and trust score calculation.

  3. Voting & Prop Firm Module (governance.cairo): Manages voting mechanisms, vote validation, external data integration, warning/ban systems, prop firm pool management, fund allocation for beginners, and statistics tracking.

- **Particle**: Ensures seamless user onboarding and interaction with blockchain networks for executing trades and smart contract functionalities. (currently now in use)
